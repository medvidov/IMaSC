The results show only a very small shift in NAT formation temperature contours so we conclude that the PSCs are not sequestering a significant fraction of HNO3 and that the southern PSC exists in a subsaturated environment.

There are three predominant types of PSCs in the lower stratosphere: ice which forms at temperatures below \u0018185 K, nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) which forms near 195 K, and swollen sulfate/nitric acid ternary aerosols that form near the same temperature as NAT. It is believed that rapid denitrification of the vortex can occur when ice clouds form [Fahey et al., 1990]. This is common in the Antarctic vortex. If temperatures below \u0018195 K but above ice formation are sustained, large NAT particles can also form and settle out gravitationally [Fahey et al., 2001], permanently removing HNO3 and halting subsequent NAT formation. Aerosol lidars can be used to distinguish between the liquid aerosols, NAT and ice clouds using information from depolarization of the backscattered lidar beam and the wavelength dependence of the backscattering, which is representative of the size distribution of the aerosols [Browell et al., 1990a Brooks et al., 2004]."}

In contrast, MLS HCl is typically within 5% of the ACE HCl values, certainly in the upper stratosphere and in the more quiescent SH lower stratosphere.

{"text": "[1] An intrusion of vortex edge air into the interior of the Arctic polar vortex was observed on the 31 January 2005 flight of the NASA DC-8 aircraft. This intrusion was identified as anomalously high values of ozone by Airborne Raman Ozone, Temperature, and Aerosol Lidar (AROTAL) and Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL). Our analysis shows that this intrusion formed when a blocking feature near Iceland collapsed, allowing edge air to sweep into the vortex interior. Analysis of Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) observations made along the DC-8 flight track also shows the intrusion in both ozone and HNO3. Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) were observed by the DIAL lidar on the DC-8. The spatial variability of the PSCs can be explained using MLS HNO3 and H2O observations and meteorological analysis temperatures. We also estimate vortex denitrification using the relationship between N2O and HNO3. Reverse domain fill back trajectory calculations are used to focus on the features in the MLS data. The trajectory results improve the agreement between lidar measured ozone and MLS ozone and also improve the agreement between the HNO3 measurements and PSC locations. The back trajectory calculations allow us to compute the local denitrification rate and reduction of HCl within the filament. We estimate a denitrification rate of about 10% per day after exposure to below-PSC formation temperature."}
{"text": "[24] Gao et al. [2001] noted that ozone loss within the Arctic vortex is a strong function of the level of denitrification with higher ozone loss occurring in significantly denitrified air masses. Using MLS HNO3, N2O and trajectories we can estimate denitrification. N2O can be used to compute initial NOy that in this region is mostly in the form HNO3. Using aircraft, satellite, and balloon observations, the relationship between N2O and NOy has been described by Fahey et al. [1990], Chang et al. [1996], and Kondo et al. [1996]. These papers used this relationship to estimate denitrification within the polar vortex. However, the relationship between N2O and NOy is not linear, and mixing events can create a new relationship as discussed by Plumb et al. [2000] and Esler and Waugh [2002]. Plumb et al. [2000] pointed out that mixing events between deep vortex air masses with very low NOy and vortex edge air masses with higher NOy may confuse the expected signal of PSC denitrification. Plumb et al. [2003] showed in more detail how mixing and descent in a model that lacked PSC denitrification processes can produce alternative N2O and NOy relationships that appear to show denitrification even though none occurred. Using multiple tracers, permanent denitrification by PSCs can be estimated [Rex et al., 1999 Esler and Waugh, 2002], but without additional tracers that procedure cannot be applied here."}
{"text": "in the data (not shown), the expected nonlinear relationship emerges. We note how this relationship changes as the season evolves, especially for values of N2O below about 200 ppbv. Values of N2O above 200 ppbv at 480 K are found well outside the vortex. Climatologically, most dramatic vortex descent takes place during the fall and early winter so we expect little upper stratospheric air to arrive inside the vortex after 15 December. The first intrusion event occurs on 29 December, and, although, minimum NH temperatures in 2004 - 2005 at 50 mbar first go below TNAT on about 4 December the vortex cold pool is not very extensive until after mid-December. Thus changes in the relationship between N2O and HNO3 after 15 December should be due to mixing within the vortex itself, intrusions into the vortex or heterogeneous processes affecting HNO3. [26] The curve in the <200 ppbv region flattens out with time. This behavior is consistent with the description of subsequent mixing of air within the vortex described by Plumb et al. [2003]. Nonetheless, after 31 January we see a general decrease in HNO3 in the <200 ppbv of N2O zone. The overall drop in HNO3 between 31 January and 15 February suggests permanent denitrification by PSCs rather than mixing because after 15 March minimum temperatures within the vortex were above PSC formation temperatures so the PSCs would have evaporated. Thus similarity between the 15 March curve and the 15 February curve confirms the fact that the denitrification is not due to sequestration by PSCs."}
{"text": "[31] To estimate how fast PSCs might be denitrifying the filament we can compare PSC temperature exposure history against local denitrification over the last 6 days. PSC formation temperatures computed using MLS HNO3 and H2O and back trajectories are used to link 31 and 25 January points. We restrict our analysis to the filament region inside the small box shown in Figure 10b. PSC backscatter occurs in this region but the PSC amount is very small. This is air that has been exposed to low temperatures but was not initially denitrified. The results are shown in Figure 11. Figure 11 shows that HNO3 depletion does not show up immediately. Instead it increases with below-PSC temperature exposure but only after 3 days. After 3 days, the rate is roughly 10% per day of exposure. The temperature history of these parcels shows that the temperature was above ice formation temperature during this period. The large standard deviation of these measurements probably reflects the sensitivity of PSC formation to microphysical processes [Drdla et al., 2002]. Carslaw et al. [2002] modeled the formation of large NAT particles that were observed during SOLVE [see Fahey et al., 2001] and concluded that the denitrification by these particles took place over 8 days, a longer period than available here. Tabazadeh et al. [2000] estimated the same timescale using Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite measurements of the Antarctic vortex. Since small amounts of NAT are clearly still present in the filament air mass, we have to conclude that denitrification within the filament may be ongoing so our estimates are not necessarily inconsistent with those studies."}

Retrieval simulations indicate that the average biases are small over the vertical range recommended above, with overall accuracy (closure) of better than 1%, not a major error source, and there is excellent tracking between the simulated retrieval results and the true input profiles. An iterative full forward model is used for increased accuracy over a broad altitude range. The estimated precision for stratospheric ozone compares well with the RMS scatter about the truth.

[49] The estimated single-profile precision reported by the Level 2 software varies from 0.15 to 0.2 ppbv over the range 100 to 10 hPa, degrading to 0.4 - 0.5 ppbv near 1 hPa. The observed scatter in the data, evaluated in a 20\u00b0-wide latitude band centered around the equator where natural variability is expected to be small in the lower stratosphere, suggests a measurement precision of 0.1 - 0.2 ppbv throughout the profile. Comparisons with correlative data sources have not yet been undertaken for ClO, so accuracy estimates are not available. However, time series of daytime, nighttime, and day-night difference values from almost nine months of version 1.5 data have been examined in 5\u00b0-wide equivalent latitude bands between 87.5\u00b0S and 87.5\u00b0N on the 660, 580, 520, 460, and 410 K potential temperature surfaces (corresponding to pressure levels of 22, 32, 46, 68, and 100 hPa, respectively). At level, nighttime mixing ratios are approximately zero at all equivalent latitudes and seasons for both ClO products. At the lower levels, however, a persistent negative bias of as much as 0.3 ppbv is evident at low and middle latitudes in both daytime and nighttime mixing ratios from the ClO-640 GHz retrievals. At polar latitudes, the ClO-640 GHz nighttime mixing ratios temporarily exhibit nonnegligible positive values during the winter when ClO is enhanced at other seasons a negative bias comparable to that always present at low and middle latitudes is seen. Taking day-night differences in the lower stratosphere effectively eliminates the negative bias it also leads to reduced ClO mixing ratios during the winter enhancement at polar latitudes, since nighttime values are slightly positive at that time/location."}
{"text": "[42] The standard product for version 1.5 HNO3 is taken from the 240 GHz retrieval at and below 10 hPa, and from the 190 GHz retrieval at and above 6.8 hPa. The vertical resolution of the standard HNO3 product is estimated to be 3.5 km over the range 147 to 10 hPa, degrading to 4.5 km at 3.2 hPa. Over most of the recommended vertical range, the estimated single-profile precision reported by the Level 2 software varies from 1.0 to 1.5 ppbv the observed scatter in the data, evaluated in a 20\u00b0-wide latitude band centered around the equator where atmospheric variability is expected to be small, suggests a measurement precision of 1 ppbv throughout the profile. Preliminary comparisons with a climatology based on seven years of UARS MLS HNO3 measurements [Santee et al., 2004] suggest that EOS MLS HNO3 may be biased high by several ppbv near the profile peak. Much closer agreement with the UARS climatology is generally found at other latitudes/altitudes/seasons. Comparisons of HNO3 profiles from MLS and ACE at middle and high latitudes in both hemispheres over the January - March 2005 time period [Froidevaux et al., 2006] indicate that, in an average sense, MLS HNO3 is high relative to ACE by at least 2 - 3 ppbv (30%) at the levels surrounding the profile peak. Average agreement between the two satellite measurements is better (typically within 10%) near the top and bottom of the profile. Despite the apparent offset between MLS and ACE near the profile peak, however, comparisons of nearly coincident individual measurements show good agreement in capturing the overall shapes of the HNO3 profiles and tracking variations in them. Comparisons with HNO3 measurements from the FIRS-2 and Mark IV instruments obtained during a balloon campaign from Ft. Sumner, NM in September 2004 lead to similar conclusions: MLS mixing ratios exceed those measured by the balloon instruments by as much as 3 ppbv at the levels around the profile peak, with agreement typically much better at the top and bottom of the vertical range [Froidevaux et al., 2006]. The discrepancies between HNO3 abundances measured by MLS and those measured by ACE, FIRS-2, and Mark IV may arise in part because of uncertainties in either the infrared or the microwave spectroscopy this possibility is under investigation. The altitude, latitude, and seasonal dependence of the apparent high bias in the MLS version 1.5 HNO3 data will be explored in more detail in future validation studies, both through analysis of potential shortcomings in the MLS retrieval system and comparisons with additional correlative (ground-based, aircraft, balloon, and satellite) data sources."}
