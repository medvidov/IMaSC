# IMaSC
Intelligent Mission and Scientific Instrument Classification. Applying unique NLP approaches to improve information extraction through scientific papers/Foundry A-Team Studies.

## The Data
Available datasets can be found in the `data` directory. The `microwave_limb_sounder` dataset contains a data dump of data from an Elasticsearch index, which contains documents with their parsed text ([PDF Miner](https://github.com/euske/pdfminer) was used to extract text from the PDF documents). The dataset also contains some, but not all, source PDFs. There are `1109` JSON documents but only `604` PDFs. The PDFs could be used with an altetrnative means of text extraction if desired and new machine-readable data generated for use in modeling.

### Generating usable datasets
To generate training, validation, and testing sets, run 'parser.py' with default inputs. This will generate the three files `training_set.jsonl`, 
`validation_set.jsonl`, and `testing_set.jsonl` in the `data/microwave_limb_sounder` directory.
